          Nintendo was founded September 23rd, 1889 as 'Nintendo Karuta' by
          Fusajiro Yamauchi in Kyoto, Japan. Yamauchi founded the company to
          manufacture and distribute <em>hanafuda</em>, a type of Japanese
          playing cards. By 1929, Nintendo had become the largest card game
          company in Japan.

          In 1975, Nintendo released what they consider their
          <a href="workscited.html" target="_blank"
            >first video game<sup>1</sup></a
          >, <a href="https://nintendo.fandom.com/wiki/EVR_Race">EVR Race</a>,
          in arcades across Japan. It was a game that was simple in concept, but
          complex in execution. The game was essentially six players "betting"
          on horses on-screen to win a race; whoever's horse won, won the game.
          However, due to the complex machinery (for the time) involved, EVR
          Race units broke down regularly, showing Nintendo the difficulties of
          maintaining an arcade machine post-launch. Nintendo's true
          breakthrough arcade game would be the extremely popular Donkey Kong,
          released in arcades six years later in 1981.

          Motivated by the success of the home consoles released by Atari and
          Magnavox in the mid-to-late 70s, Nintendo President Sekiryo Kaneda
          (who would adopt the surname of the previous Nintendo president,
          Yamauchi) entered into an agreement with Mitsubishi to develop similar
          products. On June 1st, 1977, Nintendo released their first video game
          home console: The Color TV-Game 6. It included 6 variations of the
          game <em>Pong</em>, and released at a price significantly lower than
          the competition (Â¥9,800 Yen or $86 USD), which helped it sell over
          1,000,000 units.

          In July 1983, Nintendo released the Family Computer (Famicom) in
          Japan. This would be Nintendo's first console capable of playing
          different games via a cartridge system. To boost sales early on,
          Nintendo ported their arcade smash hits - Donkey Kong and Donkey Kong
          Jr. - to the console.
        </p>
        <p class="center">
          Unfortunately, the launch of the Famicom was not without its hiccups. The
          first run of consoles shipped with numerous software bugs and hardware
          failures, causing the system to crash regularly. Nintendo recalled all
          of the first batch of consoles almost immediately, and replaced the
          motherboards. After this, the Famicom would become a top-selling
          electronic in Japan for 1983 and beyond.

          In 1985, Nintendo released the NES (<em>Nintendo Entertainment System</em>) in the United States. This was considered an incredibly bold move, as North America was in the midst of its "video game crash." Due to over-saturation and loose licensing policies allowing poorly-made games to be released on competitor's consoles, Americans generally were over the "video game fad" at this time - so much so that Nintendo of America had to promise a 100% buy-back guarantee to retailers for any unsold console just to get the NES on shelves.

          However, despite all of the doubt, the NES would go on to sell 60,000,000 units in its TEN-YEAR lifespan, holding the title as Nintendo's best-selling system until the Wii would take the crown, over 3 decades after the NES launched. The strength of its game library no doubt led to this. Atari and Sega titles just couldn't compete at the level Super Mario Bros and Duck Hunt were at.
