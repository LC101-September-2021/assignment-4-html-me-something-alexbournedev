          Nintendo was founded September 23rd, 1889 as 'Nintendo Karuta' by
          Fusajiro Yamauchi in Kyoto, Japan. Yamauchi founded the company to
          manufacture and distribute <em>hanafuda</em>, a type of Japanese
          playing cards. By 1929, Nintendo had become the largest card game
          company in Japan.

          In 1975, Nintendo released what they consider their <a href="workscited.html" target="_blank">first video game<sup>1</sup></a>,
          <a href="https://nintendo.fandom.com/wiki/EVR_Race">EVR Race</a>, in
          arcades across Japan. It was a game that was simple in concept, but
          complex in execution. The game was essentially six players "betting"
          on horses on-screen to win a race; whoever's horse won, won the game.
          However, due to the complex machinery (for the time) involved, EVR
          Race units broke down regularly, showing Nintendo the difficulties of
          maintaining an arcade machine post-launch. Nintendo's true
          breakthrough arcade game would be the extremely popular Donkey Kong,
          released in arcades six years later in 1981.

        <p>
          Motivated by the success of the home consoles released by Atari and
          Magnavox in the mid-to-late 70s, Nintendo President Sekiryo Kaneda
          (who would adopt the surname of the previous Nintendo president,
          Yamauchi) entered into an agreement with Mitsubishi to develop similar
          products. On June 1st, 1977, Nintendo released their first video game
          home console: The Color TV-Game 6. It included 6 variations of the
          game <em>Pong</em>, and released at a price significantly lower than
          the competition (Â¥9,800 Yen or $86 USD), which helped it sell over
          1,000,000 units.
